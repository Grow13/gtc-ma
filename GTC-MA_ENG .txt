1. JUSTIFICATION
=============================================

Academic metadata has become a graveyard of silent errors.
A single corrupted record replicates across dozens of catalogs,
making knowledge invisible or distorted.

There is no formal citizen channel to report and demand correction.
An individual researcher is ignored. An institutional group is not.

GTC-MA is born to audit, document, and correct serious errors
in the global bibliographic infrastructure.

=============================================
2. OBJECTIVES
=============================================

General:
To establish a replicable, public, and effective mechanism
for detecting and correcting errors in academic bibliographic metadata.

Specific:
1. Document cases of contamination by ISBN, platform, and error type.
2. Intervene systematically with publishers, libraries, and aggregators.
3. Demand correction with deadlines and public verification.
4. Raise awareness about negligence in catalog maintenance.
5. Propose minimum quality control standards for metadata.

## 📌 Inaugural Case: *Modeling Love Dynamics*

**Title:** Modeling Love Dynamics  
**Authors:** S. Rinaldi, F. Della Rossa, F. Dercole, A. Gragnani, P. Landi  
**Publisher:** World Scientific, 2015  
**Correct ISBN (hardcover):** 978-981-4696-31-9  
**Affected ISBN:** 978-981-4696-33-3  
**Platforms with error:** IngentaConnect, Bookwire

---

### 🔍 Case Summary

In February 2026, a record with ISBN **978-981-4696-33-3** was found on **IngentaConnect** containing a completely wrong table of contents. It belonged to a book on US-Japan security relations, not the actual book.

A correction process was initiated with:
- British Library
- World Scientific
- IngentaConnect (including direct contact with the CEO)
- Bookwire

---

### 📂 Status by Platform

| Platform | Contact | Response | Status |
|------------|----------|-----------|--------|
| **British Library** | Sam Ziesler | ✅ Replied | Correct. No error in BL. |
| **World Scientific** | — | ✅ Verified | ISBN and metadata correct. |
| **IngentaConnect** | Paul Overend | ✅ Replied | The book should not be on Ingenta. Requested deletion of phantom record. |
| **Bookwire** | info@, atendimento@ | ⏳ Pending | No response yet. |

---

### 🧠 Key Findings

- The record with ISBN 978-981-4696-33-3 **did exist** on IngentaConnect.
- It was personally seen by the GTC-MA team.
- It contained the table of contents of a completely different book.
- Ingenta confirmed that World Scientific **does not subscribe** to their platform, so no record of this book should exist there.
- The fact that it no longer appears in searches suggests it was **deleted after the complaint**.
- Internet Archive confirms general captures of Ingenta up to February 2026, though not of the exact URL.
